# Web Accessibility Pre-Research Worksheet

## Part 1: Understanding the Landscape

**1. What does "web accessibility" mean to you?** Write your initial definition before looking anything up.

**2. Who do you think benefits from accessible websites?** List as many different groups of people as you can imagine.

**3. Think about a website you use regularly.** Can you identify any features that might help someone with a disability use it? (Examples: buttons, navigation, text size, etc.)

**4. What types of disabilities might affect how someone uses the web?** Try to list at least 5 different categories.

## Part 2: Exploring Barriers

**5. Close your eyes and try to navigate a familiar website using only your keyboard** (no mouse). What was difficult? What was impossible?

**6. Turn off the sound on your device and watch a video.** What information did you miss? How did this change your experience?

**7. What barriers might prevent someone from accessing web content?** Think beyond just the disability itself—consider technology, design choices, and other factors.

**8. Have you ever encountered a website that was difficult to use?** What made it frustrating? Could those issues also affect people with disabilities?

## Part 3: Legal and Ethical Dimensions

**9. Do you think website owners have a legal obligation to make their sites accessible?** Why or why not?

**10. Should all websites be required to be accessible, or only certain types?** Explain your reasoning.

**11. What might be the consequences** (legal, financial, social) **for organizations that don't prioritize web accessibility?**

**12. Beyond legal requirements, what ethical reasons exist for making websites accessible?**

## Part 4: Technical Considerations & Coding for Accessibility

**13. Look at this button code:** `<div onclick="submitForm()">Submit</div>`  
**What accessibility problems might this create?** How would you improve it?

**14. What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute on images?** When should it be empty (`alt=""`) versus having descriptive text?

**15. Examine this form field:**
```html
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your email">
```
**What's missing that would help screen reader users?** Rewrite this code snippet to be more accessible.

**16. What is semantic HTML and why does it matter for accessibility?** Give examples of semantic elements versus non-semantic alternatives (e.g., `<button>` vs `<div>`).

**17. A student creates a custom dropdown menu using only `<div>` and `<span>` elements with JavaScript.** What accessibility issues might arise? What attributes or techniques could make it accessible? (Hint: research ARIA attributes like `role`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`)

**17a. What does ARIA stand for and what is its purpose?** Research and explain what these ARIA attributes do:
- `aria-label`
- `aria-labelledby`
- `aria-describedby`
- `aria-hidden`
- `aria-live`

**17b. Examine this icon button:**
```html
<button><i class="icon-trash"></i></button>
```
**A sighted user sees a trash can icon, but what does a screen reader user hear?** How would you use ARIA to fix this?

**18. What does "keyboard navigation" mean?** Find a website and try navigating it using only the Tab key, Enter, and arrow keys. What elements could you interact with? What couldn't you access?

**19. What is color contrast and why is it important?** If you have a light gray text (#999999) on a white background, how might you determine if it's accessible?

**20. Look at this link:** `<a href="document.pdf">Click here</a>`  
**What makes this poor for accessibility?** How would you improve the link text and what additional information might be helpful to include?

## Part 5: Real-World Application

**17. Choose a popular website and spend 5 minutes exploring it.** List 3 things that seem accessible and 3 potential accessibility issues.

Website: ___________________________

Accessible features:
- 
- 
- 

Potential issues:
- 
-

**18. If you were hired to make a company website more accessible, what would be your first three questions or concerns?**

**19. How might web accessibility practices benefit users who don't have disabilities?** Think about different contexts like mobile use, slow internet, noisy environments, etc.

**20. What aspect of web accessibility are you most curious to learn more about?** This may help focus your research paper topic.
