  		//Problem 1
  		//Create a date object by calling the Date constructor function, assign the object to a constant named 'today'.
  		//Invoke the getTime() method of 'today' and log the return value.
  		//Invoke the toDateString() method of 'today' and log the return value.

		const today = new Date();
		console.log(today.getTime());
		console.log(today.toDateString());

  		//Problem 2
  		// Use the Date() constructor function to create a date object that represents your birthday.
  		// Pass in parameters to the constructor function to set the date object to your birthday.
  		// Assign the returned object in a constant called 'myBirthday'
  		// BE CAREFUL: Month numbers start with 0, not 1
  		// Then log the date so that it's easy to read your birthday (use the toDateString() method)

		const myBirthday = new Date(1999, 8, 7);
		console.log(myBirthday.toDateString());

  		//Problem 3
  		// Use the Date constructor function without any parameters to create a date object.
  		// You can store the return object in a constant called 'newYearsEve'.
  		// Then use various methods of the object to set the date to December 31 of the current year.
  		// HINT: you will have to use the following methods: setFullYear(), setMonth(), setDate()

		const newYearsEve = new Date();
		newYearsEve.setFullYear(2026);
		newYearsEve.setMonth(11);
		newYearsEve.setDate(31);
		console.log(newYearsEve.toDateString());
  		
  		// Problem 4
  		// Write a function that converts milliseconds to days
  		// The function should have a parameter that represents a number of millisceconds
  		// The function should return the equivalent number in days

		const converter = milliseconds => {
			let days = milliseconds / 86400000
			return days
		};
		console.log(converter(86400000));

  		// Problem 5
  		// Use the today constant from problem 1 and the newYearsEve constant from problem 3
  		// to figure out how many days from now until newYearsEve.
  		// Hint, figure out the difference in milliseconds, and then use the function that you wrote
  		// for problem 4 to convert the milliseconds to days

		const daysUntilNewYears = newYearsEve - today;
		console.log(converter(daysUntilNewYears));

  		// Bonus Problem
  		// Use various methods of the Date object to determine the significance of the specialDay variable below
  		// Then log a message that explains what day it is

  		var specialDay = new Date(-6106004517529); 
		console.log("On " + specialDay.toDateString() + ", the United States declared independence!");

  		// Bonus Problem
  		// Write a function called getDayOfWeek(). 
  		// Include a parameter that represents a date object.
  		// The function should return the day name of the parameter
  		// (for example: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday)
  		// When you are done, test the function (pass in today's date), and log the return value

		console.log("I used AI on this bonus quuestion so you dont have to get me points for it. I understood what I had to do but I just couldnt piece everything together to where it would make sense to work. The hardest part was trying to figure out the return statement!")
		const getDayOfWeek = day => {
			const days = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"]
			return days[day.getDay()]
		};
		console.log(getDayOfWeek(today));

	<h1>JavaScript Date API Worksheet</h1>
	<h2>Questions</h2>
	<p>This <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp" target="_blank">reference</a> may be helpful in understanding how you can work with Date objects.</p>
	<h4>Question 1</h4>
	<p class="question">
	    If you invoke the Date constructor without passing in any parameters, what date will be stored in the object that is returned?
	</p>
	<div class="answer">
	    It would store the current date and time.
	</div>

	<h4>Question 2</h4>
	<p class="question">
	    What is an 'epoch'?
	</p>
	<div class="answer">
	    Epoch is the event when dates and time were first measured.
	</div>

	<h4>Question 3</h4>
	<p class="question">
	    What is a 'Unix timestamp' (also known as 'epoch time')?
	</p>
	<div class="answer">
	    Unix timestamp is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch. Unix epoch is when time and dates were first meausred in JavaScript.
	</div>

	<h4>Question 4</h4>
	<p class="question">
	    What is the actual date of the epoch for Unix timestamps?
	</p>
	<div class="answer">
	    January 1, 1970 at midnight.
	</div>

	<h4>Question 5</h4>
	<p class="question">
	    What does the getTime() method of a date object return (refer to the link that was mentioned above, or find another reference on the Date object in JavaScript)?
	</p>
	<div class="answer">
	    The getTime() method tells you how many milliseconds has passed since Unix epoch.
	</div>

	<h4>Question 6</h4>
	<p class="question">
	    If you are working with 2 date objects, how could you use the getTime() method to determine if one date is more recent than the other?
	</p>
	<div class="answer">
	    You would want to use the getTime() method on both dates then you could convert those millisecond to days to see which came first since itll be easier to read days then milliseconds.
	</div>
